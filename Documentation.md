What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of services over the internet (cloud) using a variety of computing resources and capabilities. These services include:

Compute Power: Servers such as Windows and Linux, hosting environments, and virtual machines.

Storage: File storage and databases for data management.

Networking: Connectivity within cloud environments like Azure, as well as connections to external networks such as company networks.

Analytics Services: Tools for data visualization and telemetry analysis.

CapEx vs OpEx
Capital Expenditure (CapEx)	Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
Up front cost	Significant	None
Ongoing cost	Low	Based on usage
Tax Deduction	Over time	Same year
Early Termination	No	Anytime
Maintenance	Significant	Low
Value over time	Lowers	No change
What is a Consumption-Based Model?
The consumption-based model in cloud computing is a pricing model where customers are billed based on their actual resource usage. Key characteristics include:

No Upfront Cost: Customers are not charged upfront; costs accrue based on usage.

No Wasted Resources: Charges are incurred only for resources actively used. For example, blob storage that stores data incurs charges based on the space used, while running virtual machines incur charges for CPU, memory, etc., even when idle.

Pay for What You Need: Flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand.

Stop Paying When You Don't: Costs cease when resources are no longer required.

Consumption
Consumption is the virtual metric used to measure and bill resources in a cloud environment. It ensures efficient use of resources and cost management based on actual utilization.
