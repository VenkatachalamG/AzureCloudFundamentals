<h2>What is a Consumption-Based Model?</h2>
    <p>The consumption-based model in cloud computing is a pricing model where customers are billed based on their actual resource usage. Key characteristics include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Upfront Cost: Customers are not charged upfront; costs accrue based on usage.</li>
        <li>No Wasted Resources: Charges are incurred only for resources actively used. For example, blob storage that stores data incurs charges based on the space used, while running virtual machines incur charges for CPU, memory, etc., even when idle.</li>
        <li>Pay for What You Need: Flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand.</li>
        <li>Stop Paying When You Don't: Costs cease when resources are no longer required.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Consumption</h2>
    <p>Consumption is the virtual metric used to measure and bill resources in a cloud environment. It ensures efficient use of resources and cost management based on actual utilization.</p>
<h1>Service Models Responsibilities</h1>
    <p>Diagram representing the layers of an application, platform, and hardware in an organizational use case.</p>
    <p>In a cloud infrastructure, layers include application, platform, and hardware. The application layer involves software and services users interact with. The platform layer provides runtime environments, middleware, and operating systems. The hardware layer includes servers, storage, and networking components, managed by the cloud provider for seamless operation. Above the hardware and application platform layers in cloud infrastructure, there's a crucial management and orchestration layer. This layer coordinates resources across multiple servers and data centers, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. It integrates automation and monitoring tools to streamline operations and enhance the overall efficiency of cloud services delivery.</p>

<h2>What is a Data Center?</h2>
    <p>A data center is a physical facility designed for hosting a group of networked servers including its own dedicated power supply, cooling systems, and networking infrastructure. These facilities are essential for ensuring continuous operations and optimal performance of servers and data storage.</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Geographical area on the planet.</b></li>
        <li><b>One but usually more data centers connected with low-latency network (<2 milliseconds).</b></li>
        <li><b>Location for your services.</b></li>
        <li><b>Some services are available only in certain regions.</b></li>
        <li><b>Some services are global services, as such are not assigned/deployed in specific region.</b></li>
        <li><b>Globally available with 50+ regions.</b></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Availability Zone</h2>
    <p>A regional feature in cloud infrastructure involves the grouping of physically separate facilities within a geographical region. These facilities are strategically located to enhance reliability and resilience against data center failures. By dispersing infrastructure across multiple sites within a region, cloud providers ensure that services remain accessible and operational even in the event of localized disruptions or failures, thereby maintaining continuity and minimizing downtime for users and applications.</p>

<h2>Two Service Categories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zonal services (Virtual Machines, Disks, etc.).</b></li>
        <li><b>Zone-redundant services (SQL, Storage, etc.).</b></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Not all Regions</h2>
    <p>Not all regions in cloud computing infrastructure are uniformly supported, as availability varies based on geographic location and provider infrastructure deployment strategies. A supported region typically consists of three or more availability zones, with each zone comprising one or more data centers.</p>

<h2>Region Pair</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Each region is paired with another region making it a region pair.</b></li>
        <li><b>Region pairs are static and cannot be chosen (manually).</b></li>
        <li><b>Each pair resides within the same geography with exception being Brazil South with its region pair residing in United States.</b></li>
        <li><b>Physical isolation with at least 300 miles distance (when possible).</b></li>
    </ul>

<h3>Example of some Region-Pairs:</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>REGION PAIR A</th>

<h2>Azure Resources</h2>
<p>Azure Resources are the objects that are used to manage the various Azure services that we create. Each Resource represents or contains information about a resource or service lifecycle. Each time we create an Azure Resource, it is created as a .config JSON file.</p>

![pic3](https://github.com/VenkatachalamG/AzureCloudFundamentals/assets/119162683/5f716093-bb4d-4786-84ad-bda60f023a71)
<h5>An Example of an Azure Resource Group JSON Config File</h5>

<h2>Azure Resource Groups</h2>
<p>Azure Resource Groups are logical collection or grouping of Azure Resources. They were created as a tool to group Azure Resources to manage them. There are many ways in which Azure Resources can be grouped. Some logically defined ones are:</p>
<ul>
   <li><h3>Grouped by Resource Type</h3>
<p>This is a kind of grouping where the goal or need is to group the resources by the category of the resource. For example, you could group all SQL resources under one resource group and group all Web Apps Resource in another resource group.</p>

![Picture1](https://github.com/VenkatachalamG/AzureCloudFundamentals/assets/119162683/7b7b8b11-de38-4ffc-b98e-6d18e21e0e02)
<h5>An Example of Grouping Azure Resources by Resource Type</h5></li>

   <li><h3>Grouped by Application Lifecycle</h3>
<p>This is a kind of grouping where the goal or need is to group the resources by the lifecycle of the application being developed so that you can test and deploy environments separately and apply any configurations, policies or any network rules easily and efficiently.</p></li>

![Picture2](https://github.com/VenkatachalamG/AzureCloudFundamentals/assets/119162683/c796967c-e1c8-4068-838d-c148da6a6246)
<h5>An Example of Grouping Azure Resources by Application Lifecycle/Environments</h5>

   <li><h3>Grouped by Department, Location, Billing</h3>
<p>This is a kind of grouping where the goal or need is to group the resources by the amount of costs of each resource for efficient billing purposes, by the department type so that teams can quickly access their application resources and track and report on cloud spending by department, or by the location so you can apply data sovereignty and security rules easily for data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As there is not one single policy that can satisfy all the needs of an organization, organizations tend to use a combination of all the above-mentioned grouping types. Combining these criteria allows for a more tailored and efficient organization of resources, providing better control and visibility in managing Azure environments.</p>

<h2>Resource Manager</h2>
<p>We can provision our Azure Resources and create Azure Resource Groups and basically access our Azure Account through various methods. We can use the Azure portal, use Azure CLI, through a REST API, or through some SDKs. But all of them eventually go through a single point of management and authentication called the Azure Resource Manager (ARM). The Azure ARM is a centralized management layer for all resources and is linked with the Entra ID (previously known as Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for authentication and authorization of users. Therefore, the two features of Azure ARM are unified language and control access and resources.</p>

<h1>Virtualization</h1>
  <p>
    Virtualization is a technology that allows the emulation of physical machines, enabling multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host (computer). A Virtual Machine (or VM) is an emulation of a physical computer system having virtual resources like CPU, memory, storage etc. Each VM can have different virtual hardware configurations configured to the needs of specific applications. This feature allows for the installation of different operating systems on each VM, providing total separation of environments. Such separation extends to file systems, services, ports, middleware, and configuration settings, ensuring that each VM operates independently and securely without interference from others.
  </p>
<h1>Virtual Machine Scale Sets</h1>
  <p>
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers a set of identical virtual machines equipped with built-in auto scaling features, ensuring that resources can dynamically adjust to meet varying demands. This capability is particularly beneficial for workloads that require scalability, such as web services and batch processing. With IaaS, users can efficiently manage both manual and auto-scaled workloads, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. The flexibility to scale resources up or down as needed makes IaaS an ideal choice for applications with fluctuating or unpredictable usage patterns, providing a robust and responsive infrastructure for a wide range of computing needs.
  </p>

<h1>Containers</h1>
  <p>
    Using the host's operating system, virtualization can emulate entire operating systems, with Virtual Machines (VMs) emulating the underlying hardware. However, there are more lightweight options available that do not require a full operating system, reducing development effort, maintenance, and compute and storage requirements. These lightweight virtual environments can respond quicker to changes in demand, offering greater agility and efficiency. Designed for almost any scenario, these solutions provide flexibility and scalability, making them suitable for a variety of applications and workloads, from development and testing to production and high-demand environments.
    <br>
    Examples include Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, LXC (Linux Containers), etc.
  </p>

<h1>Azure Container Instances</h1>
  <p>
    The simplest and fastest way to run a container in Azure is through Platform as a Service (PaaS) with serverless containers. Designed for small and simple web apps/services, background jobs, and scheduled scripts, this approach offers efficient, scalable solutions without the need for managing underlying infrastructure.
  </p>

<h1>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</h1>
  <p>
    Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, offers highly scalable and customizable solutions as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is designed for high-scale container deployments, capable of managing a vast array of applications and services, making it ideal for any large-scale containerized environment.
  </p>

<h1>App Service</h1>
  <p>
    Azure App Service is designed as an enterprise-grade web application service, offering Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities. It supports multiple programming languages and containers, providing a versatile and scalable solution for deploying and managing web applications in a robust and efficient manner.
  </p>
<h1>Azure Functions (Function Apps)</h1>
  <p>
    As a Platform as a Service (PaaS), Azure Functions offers a serverless environment with two hosting and pricing models: a consumption-based plan and a dedicated plan. Designed for micro and nano-services, it provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for running small, modular functions without managing infrastructure.
